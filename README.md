This repository contains a shell script that demonstrates an uncommon bug related to finding the largest number in an array. The bug surfaces when the array includes negative numbers or numbers with leading spaces.  The `bug.sh` file shows the buggy code, and `bugSolution.sh` provides a corrected version. This example highlights the importance of careful input validation and robust comparison techniques in shell scripting.
